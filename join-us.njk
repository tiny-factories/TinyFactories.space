<h2>How do I apply for the waitlist?</h2>

<p>
To apply for the waitlist, tell us a little bit about yourself via <strong><a href="https://tiny-factories.typeform.com/to/hotpAx">this form</a></strong> and expect to hear from us! 
<br>
However, this group is not trying to become another mega-slack-group with too many strangers. We want to make sure that each of us know one another well. So we might have to sadly decline some of the applicants who might not fit with the group culture.
</p>

<h2>It’s not free to join, right?</h2>

<p>
Unfortunately, no. We started the community as a free to join group, but as we expanded, we realised we want to offer the community more. That is why we decided to have a collective piggy bank to help cover some of the group toolings we have and also help the staff who are moderating the community.
</p>

<p>
We believe it takes a while to truly become a part of a friend and peer group, so we offer a free trial period of 1 month. After that period you can decide if you want to become a member of the group!  Currently, as a member we each contribute $10 every month (for now).
